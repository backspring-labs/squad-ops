    does the result become ``missed`` (it never pre-empts ``active``, since the
    agent could still enter while the window is open). The default ``True`` makes
    the documented ``window_state(assignment, now)`` a pure time classifier — all
    the §2.5 reserve guard needs, since it acts only on ``in_reserve_before`` and
    ``active``.
