"""
Runtime state dataclasses for SIP-0089.

Phase 1: `AgentRuntimeState` mirrors SIP-0089 §10.1.
Phase 2 (§2.1): `Assignment` + `DutyWindow` mirror §10.2/§10.3, plus the
`window_state()` time classifier used by the scheduler (§2.4) and the cycle
reserve-buffer guard (§2.5).
Phase 3 (§3.1): `FocusLease` mirrors §10.4, plus the `LeaseDecision` union
(`LeaseGranted` / `LeaseRejected` / `LeasePreempting`) returned by the
`FocusLeasePort`. Queueing (`LeaseQueued`) is deferred to v1.2+ (§3.0/D20).

All models are frozen dataclasses; mutate via `dataclasses.replace()`. `Literal`
types in code mirror the DB `CHECK` constraints (D3).
