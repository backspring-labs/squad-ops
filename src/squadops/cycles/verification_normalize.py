"""Normalize task-result verification evidence into ``CheckResult`` (SIP-0096 Phase 2).

The Phase-1 pure core (`verification_integrity`) is deliberately producer-agnostic:
it classifies a normalized ``CheckResult`` and never knows the shape of any
producer. This module is the **producer adapter** the Phase-1 design deferred —
it maps a completed task's ``outputs`` (the qa/dev handlers' ``validation_result``
checks + ``test_result``) into ``CheckResult`` objects the executor records on the
``RunLedger``. Pure (dict → list[CheckResult]); no I/O.

Two producer shapes are folded here (both land in ``outputs`` and flow back to the
executor at the dispatch seam):

- **SIP-0092 typed-acceptance rows** (`check` = ``acceptance:<name>``) — emitted for
  *every* criterion, carrying a ``CheckOutcome`` ``status`` (passed/failed/skipped/
  error) directly. Per-cycle identity (§6.3): disclosed, not required-addressable.
- **Framework test-spine checks** — ``tests_pass`` and ``no_stub_fallback_tests`` are
  appended to ``checks`` **only on failure**, so a passing run records no row. Relying
  on the row alone would make a green run look like "no result" and — once the check
  is required (Phase 2 slice 4) — falsely block it. So ``tests_pass`` is synthesized
  from the always-present ``test_result`` dict, and the §6.6.1 stub signal
  (``no_stub_fallback_tests`` failing) marks that synthesized pass as a stub so it
  cannot credit.
