  The PRD requires a Team Status Dashboard that displays activity feed and project progress tracking. This feature is crucial for the team to stay updated on ongoing projects and tasks. From a technical standpoint, we will need to integrate with existing systems to fetch real-time data and display it in an user-friendly manner.

## 7️⃣ Infrastructure Status

**Services:**
- ✅ RabbitMQ (event-driven messaging)
- ✅ PostgreSQL (task logging and metrics)
- ✅ Task Management API (execution cycle tracking)
- ✅ Docker (container lifecycle management)

**Agents:**
- ✅ Max (Lead/Governance) — Event listener and wrap-up generation
- ✅ Neo (Development) — Task execution and completion events

**System Health:**
- CPU: 0.6%
- Memory: 22.6%
- Docker Events: 0 recent events

---

## 8️⃣ Next Steps

- [ ] Deploy hello-squad container to production
- [ ] Archive current version to archive folder
- [ ] Update version manifest
- [ ] Schedule next WarmBoot run (run-074)
- [ ] Consider activating EVE and Data agents for Phase 2

---

## 📝 SIP-027 Phase 1 Status

This wrap-up was automatically generated by Max using **SIP-027 Phase 1** event-driven coordination.  
Neo emitted `task.developer.completed` events, which triggered automated wrap-up generation.

**Phase 1 Features Validated:**
- ✅ Event-driven completion detection
- ✅ Automated telemetry collection (DB, RabbitMQ, System, Docker)
- ✅ Automated wrap-up generation with comprehensive metrics
- ✅ Volume mount integration (container → host filesystem)
- ✅ ECID-based traceability

**Ready for Phase 2:** Multi-agent coordination with EVE (QA) and Data (Analytics)
